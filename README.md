## Overview
Deepfake technology has become increasingly sophisticated, making it harder to distinguish between real and fake images. This project leverages a **deep learning model** (Xception) trained on a dataset of real and fake images to classify uploaded images as "Real" or "Fake."

The app is built using **Streamlit**, making it easy to use and deploy.

---

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload an image to classify it as "Real" or "Fake."
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Get instant results with confidence scores.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI powered by Streamlit.
- **Scalable**: Built with TensorFlow, allowing for easy model upgrades.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepFake-Detector.git
   cd DeepFake-Detector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model:
   - Place the `xception_deepfake_detection_model.h5` file in the root directory.
   - (Optional) Train your own model using the provided dataset.

---

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Upload an image using the file uploader.

4. View the prediction result ("Real" or "Fake") along with the confidence score.

---

## Dataset
The model was trained on the [Deepfake and Real Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images) from Kaggle. 
The dataset contains:
- **Real Images**: Authentic images of human faces.
- **Fake Images**: Deepfake-generated images.

---

## Model Architecture
The model is based on **Xception**, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Key components:
- **Base Model**: Xception (pretrained on ImageNet).
- **Custom Layers**:
  - Global Average Pooling
  - Dense Layers with Dropout
  - Sigmoid Activation for Binary Classification

### Training Details
- **Input Size**: 224x224
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
- **Epochs**: 10 (initial training) + 5 (fine-tuning)
